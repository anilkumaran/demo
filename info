1. Create Jenkins master manually from AWS CFN console
    Stack Name: jenkins-master
    temlate-localtion: devops/jenkins-master.yaml
    AMI: ami-0522ab6e1ddcc7055 (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS)
    RAM: min 2GB (t2.small)
    HardDisk: min 8GB
    keypair: ak-jenkins-master
    Install Jenkins: https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/

2. Connect git to Jenkins
    i. Create ssh key for user "jenkins" on jenkins master
        ssh to jenkins master
        sudo su jenkins
        cd
        ssh-keygen -t rsa (click enter enter )
        cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
        copy the text
    ii. Create a jenkins credential
        go to Manage Jenkins -> credentials -> create new -> SSH username with private key
        ID: jenkins-master-ssh-key
        usernane: jenkins
        privatekey: enter directly
    iii. Add jenkin's ssh key to git
        a. Login to jenkins master -> sudo su -> cd -> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -> copy the text
        b. Go to git -> yourprofile (or jenkins user profile) -> Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> new ssh key
        c. check connectivity by logging into jenkins master -> sudo su -> cd -> ssh -T git@github.com
    iv. Test the connectivity from jenkins to git and vicevers using a webhook
        a. go to your project https://github.com/anilkumaran/demo -> settings -> Webhooks -> Add webhook
        Payoad URL: http://Jenkins_Public_IP:8080/github-webhook/
            ex: http://13.232.108.130:8080/github-webhook/
        Content Type: application/json
        b. click on it and verify the connectivity

3. Crate a Multibranch pipeline with name Pipeline-${APP_NAME}
    Before we create a multibranch pipeline, Use a plain Jenkins file with only one stage and an echo command as first build should be successful on main branch
    ex: Pipeline-demo
    Branch Sources: Git
    Project Repository: https://github.com/anilkumaran/demo.git
    Credentials: jenkins-master-ssh-key (credential we create in step 2 -> ii)
    Behaviour: Filter by name (with wildcards) -> main*
    Save

    A multibranch pipeline with "main" as pipeline job should be creatd


4. Setup CICD for multi environment
    i. Crete branches DEMO-CICD-PROD and DEMO-CICD-PROD and DEMO-CICD-UAT from main. 
    ii. Go to multibranch pieline -> Configure -> Behaviour: Filter by name (with wildcards) -> use DEMO-CICD-* to build only branches starting with DEMO-CICD- -> Save
        The multibranch pipeline now should have two pipelines named DEMO-CICD-PROD and DEMO-CICD-UAT which should have the 1st build in successful state
    iii. Install AWS Credential plugin https://plugins.jenkins.io/aws-credentials/
    iii. Create an IAM user nanmed jenkins in AWS manually (this is required only once) with required permissions (like create stack, delete stack, start ec2 etc)
        Cerate AccessKeyId and SecretAccesKey to use in Jenkins-Master
        Configure the above credentials in jenkins using credentials
